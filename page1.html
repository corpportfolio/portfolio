                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">What if the Underground Railroad was an actual railroad? What if Charles Lindbergh defeated Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election? In this course, we explored how alternative fiction can shed light on the reality of the world. <br><br>CORE 101 allowed me to practice multiple styles of writing, ranging from my own work of alternative fiction to a research paper. Below is a link to a condensed version of my research paper -- an assignment which permitted me to explore historiography and the woes of the American education system. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><a href="http://humanities.drury.edu/?p=3720" target="_blank">Misinformed: How a 1918 Narrative Shapes Our Discussion of Slavery and Race Today</a><br><br>Creative writing is a bit alien to me, and this course allowed me the opportunity to explore my skills. Below is a piece of alternative fiction of an event I experienced long ago -- but with some added cultists. Warning: link will download the paper as a file. <br><br><a href="assets/files/The%20Storm%20or%20How%20I%20Learned%20To%20Stop%20Worrying%20and%20Love%20the%20Cultists.docx">The Storm, or:  How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cultists</a><a href="http://humanities.drury.edu/?p=3720" target="_blank"><br></a><br>The required readings for the course included Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel; The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead; and The Plot Against America by Philip Roth.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Utopias are great, right? Maybe not. In HNRS 225, we analyzed different approaches to social justice found in fictional, scientific, philosophical, and biographical writings. <br><br>One such approach, outlined in Toni Morrison's <em>Paradise</em>, explored the pitfalls of utopianism with themes that echoed the strifes of American civil rights movements. For this novel, I wrote a paper exploring the relationship between historical legend and fact, and the ways in which the two intertwine to create a false image of social justice. You can find the paper below:<br><br><a href="assets/files/A Historiography of Utopianism.pdf">A Historiography of Utopianism: Truth in a Mythic Narration of the Past </a>  <br><br>As the name suggests, I used my love of historiography to analyze Morrison's commentary on utopianism, resulting in a synthesis between traditional narrative analysis and the processes behind the development of history.&nbsp;<br><br>Additional works include <em>Predisposed </em>by John R. Alford, John R. Hibbing, and Kevin B. Smith; <em>The idea of Justice</em> by Amartya Sen; and the writings and speeches of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">While not an honors course, HIST 350 introduced me to various historical methods, including legal analysis and oral history, making it an important class to note.&nbsp;<br><br>A standout reading was the <em>The Souls of Black Folk </em>by W. E. B. Du Bois, a seminal work in sociology, history, and American literature published in 1903. For this work, I wrote a piece on Du Bois' concept of the veil, a metaphor describing the double-consciousness experienced by African-Americans. As I wrote this paper, I learned of the methods required to write a proper historical analysis that respected the heart and character of the primary source.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="assets/files/The%20Souls%20of%20Black%20Folk%20Paper.docx">Under the Shadow of the Veil: The Search for Self-Consciousness</a><br><br>HIST 350 ended with an oral history project -- a method completely foreign to me. Tasked with interviewing Mrs. Cheryl Brown Henderson, founder of Brown Foundation for Educational Equity, Excellence and Research, a non-profit which seeks to expand upon the legacy of <em>Brown v. Board</em>. This project exposed me to the processes behind oral history and the importance of preserving personal experiences with historical records. <br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">From possessions to cannibalism, HIST 342 dove into the unbelievable history of early modern witchcraft. Primary sources form the core of this course, with pieces such as the infamous Malus Malacarum or the woodcuts of Hans Baldung Grien exposing the origins and social realities of the witch-hunt phenomena. <br><br>Throughout HIST 342, I researched the meaning of medieval magic -- a fundamental topic in understanding the origins of early modern witchcraft. In January 2020, I presented my research at the Phi Alpha Theta Biennial Convention in San Antonia, Texas alongside students across the United States. Linked below is a copy of the paper I presented at the conference: <br><br><a href="assets/files/Conjured Identities Within Conjured Lines.docx">Conjured Identities Within Conjured Lines: </a><br><a href="assets/files/Conjured Identities Within Conjured Lines.docx">Magic as a Tool for Understanding in the Middle Ages </a><br><br>My attendance at a national conference proved invaluable as I met with professors and students to discuss research and historical methods.<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Graphic novels offer pathways of analysis unachievable by standard texts. With works such as Alan Moore's Watchmen or Neil Gaiman's The Sandman, the stigma which long enveloped the medium fades, revealing a trove of valuable lessons and themes. In this honors reading seminar, we amassed an array of titles to reflect the currents of graphic novels: Marvel: 1602 by Neil Gaiman, March by John Lewis, and The Wicked + The Divine by Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie. <br><br>HNRS 250 presented a unique problem: Before the course, Marvel 1602 -- the work I presented -- gathered dusk on my bookshelf as one of my least favorite graphic novels. The varied opinions on the narrative, however, offered wholly unique perspectives which grew my appreciation for Gaiman's story.<br><br>John Lewis' March, a piece of non-fiction, demonstrated the educational and evocative story-telling capabilities of the medium. An intimate reflection on the Civil Rights Movement, Lewis' autobiographical exploration of issues on race rang clear with clever usage of fonts and frames. <br><br>The final graphic novel, The Wicked + The Divine, analyzed the troubles with celebrity worship culture. Through the graphic novel format, the piece achieved a vibrant style that matched its themes. <br><br>The intimate structure of HNRS 250, guided by small discussions, provided a rich, thoughtful analysis which not only shaped my appreciation for Marvel 1602 but expanded by love for the medium.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">As an archival intern at the History Museum on the Square, my adoration for the past, and appreciation for those who persevere it, grew twofold. Under the guidance of head archivist Lindsey Young, I learned preservation and appraisal techniques while sifting through a mass of donated items. <br><br>Central to the internship is the development of collections. By identifying materials, and denoting historical worth, the archivist forms a historical narrative. Through these collections, the past comes alive. Be it the 1918 taxes of a Springfieldian business owner or disgruntled letters between father and daughter, each item presents a view vital to history.&nbsp;<br><br><br></p>
